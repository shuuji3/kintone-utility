Utility library for development on the Kintone platform.

## Note

This library has been deprecated by the original authors and the successor is [@kintone/kintone-js-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kintone/kintone-js-sdk). 

This fork is made for the legacy project which depends on Kintone Utility. Because new features such as Cursor API are appended to Kintone platform which break some functions of this Kintone Utility. 

## Usage

### npm library
This library is published as npm library at [npmjs.com](https://npmjs.com) for using from your bundle systems such as Webpack.
